### âœ… Instructions: How the Design Was Implemented

1. **UI Analysis from Screenshots**
   Carefully reviewed the provided UI screenshots (Home and About pages) to understand layout, colors, typography, and structure.

2. **HTML Structure**

   * Created a clean `index.html` file with sections for Home and About.
   * Used semantic elements and Bootstrap classes for responsiveness.
   * Divided content into reusable parts: navbar, content areas, buttons, etc.

3. **CSS Styling (`style.css`)**

   * Created a `style.css` file and linked it externally.
   * Defined CSS variables (`--bg-color`, `--text-color`, etc.) for light/dark theme.
   * Styled the layout, text, buttons, images, and social media icons.
   * Used media queries to ensure mobile responsiveness.

4. **JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)**

   * Implemented simple page-switching logic (Home <-> About) using `showPage()` function.
   * Created a dark/light mode toggle using `toggleTheme()`.
   * Linked the JS file externally for clean separation of concerns.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**

   * Used Bootstrap grid system and media queries to ensure the website looks good on different screen sizes.

6. **Code Simplification**

   * Renamed class names and IDs to simple, beginner-friendly terms.
   * Optimized the design and layout to feel like a fresher-created project.
